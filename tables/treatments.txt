\hline
\textbf{Treatment} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Sample Size} & \textbf{Main Finding} \\ \hline
Information & Provides clear information on the quantitative incentives associated with reporting beliefs. & 60 & Increased false reports and systematic bias towards the center due to detailed incentive information. \\ \hline
No Information & Omits all quantitative information about incentives, focusing on ensuring that truthful reporting is encouraged through non-quantitative means. & 60 & Lower rate of false reports and no systematic bias, showing better compliance with truthful reporting. \\ \hline
Reduction of Compound Lottery (RCL) & Introduces a calculator tool to help participants determine the total chance of winning for any reported belief, aiming to aid in understanding the mechanismâ€™s incentive compatibility. & 59 & Reduced the rate of false reports but did not fully eliminate the pull-to-center effect found in the Information treatment. \\ \hline
Description & Similar to No Information but includes a nonquantitative description of how reported beliefs map to earnings. & 60$^*$ & Data on main findings not explicitly provided, but likely similar to No Information. \\ \hline
Feedback & Incentive information is gradually revealed through end-of-period feedback, showing participants the effects of their reported beliefs on their chances of winning, effectively demonstrating the incentive mechanism incrementally. & 60 & Initial reports similar to No Information treatment, but false reports increased over time as incentive information was revealed. \\ \hline
